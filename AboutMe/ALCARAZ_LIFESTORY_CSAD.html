	<blockquote><p><b> My childhood is awesome, why? because I play too much.<sup>1</sup> I feel free during my childhood years because I can do anything and I am always happy.<sup>2</sup> I have no problem during my childhood days thats why I am always happy.<sup>3</sup> The only problem I got is when my mother ask me to go to sleep during noon time.<sup>4</sup> I know every kid do not want to go to sleep every 12 in the afternoon and I can relate to it.<sup>5</sup> But thats not gonna stop me, because I will fake sleep and then after how many minutes I will tell my mom that I'm done sleeping and will run outside to play with my friends, My mother cannot stop me because she is busy from work.<sup>6</sup> I remember the trend game that we play during my childhood days is "pogs".<sup>7</sup> I have many pogs and I keep on collecting it even I have a full of bags of it.<sup>8</sup> I played so many filipino games like patintero, agawan base, tagutaguan, langit lupa, tumbang preso, sipa tsinelas and we even created a game that we called slipper battle x.<sup>10</sup> When years pass by, technology develope faster and then computer shops come in.<sup>11</sup> When I learned how to use computer, it became my hobby and then I learned that I can play games to it.<sup>12</sup> Thats the time that I played GTA on computer and my mom will get mad at me because I spend all my time infront of the computer and forgot to eat.<sup>13</sup> Time pass by I knew how to go online and also play online games.<sup>14</sup> Then I learned how to use the internet and then created online accounts like friendster and facebook.<sup>15</sup> When I created friendste, I remembered that you can change the style of your friendster and I made mine so cool that my friends ask me to teach them how to do it.<sup>16</sup> I learned it from youtube, and in that time I never tell them about youtube because I was so selfish and I didn't want them to learn on how to do it.<sub>17</sub> And then facebook games come in, I played pet society, farmville and cartown.<sup>18</sup> The very famous game that facebook ever created for me is tetris because I played it so many times and it is fun because you can challenge your friends.<sup>19</sup> The only thing I hate during my childhood years is going to school, because my mindset only focuses on playing games.<sup>20</sup></b></p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p><b> My college years isn't over yet, but I've experieced so much during my 1st year.<sup>1</sup> Before college start I prepared myself for entering new environment because I dont know what college means or how prof's teach in college.<sup>2</sup>Back then I entered many University, I applied in every University as many as I can, I went tried in Trinity University of Asia, in University of Santo Thomas, in Philippine University, in Polythecnic University of the Philippines, in National University and lastly, in University of the East.<sup>3</sup> Sad to say I didn't pass in UP and PUP but the other Universities I passed their entrance exams including UE.<sup>4</sup> When I got all the result from the Universities, I asked my parents where will I go, but they said it was all up to me, they will support me all through out.<sup>5</sup> I've think deeply because when my first choice was Mechanical Engineering because I love cars, but I think I will fail that course because I am not good at math so I choose my second choice which is Computer Science.<sup>6</sup> Between University of Santo Thomas and University of the East I choosed UE because I think practically and tuition fee in UST is not a joke, and my status of life is just in the middle we are not rich and we are not poor, thats why I choosed UE.<sup>7</sup> In my 1<sup>st</sup> semester in UE school year went well and I achieved a scholarship which is the college scholarship, I've discounted half of the price of my tuition fee.<sup>8</sup> I made my parents proud and they gave me a price because I am a scholar, They bought me a ps4 which is my wish for a very long time.<sup>9</sup> Then 2<sup>nd</sup> semester came in and there is math which is I am not good at, it is the Analysis for CS or the calculus happy to say I passed this subject but unfortunately my average did not meet the 1.60 requirement to maintain my scholarship I only got 1.64.<sup>10</sup> My parents did not get mad at me because I think they understand that the subject is really difficult for me.<sup>11</sup> Then covid comes and here we are doing Online Classes, at first I thought OLC is good because I am studying online and I think my schedule will not be a whole day, but I was wrong.<sup>12</sup> I got the schedule from 7am in the morning until 5pm in the after noon with 10 mins break between each subject, how tiring was that, but luckily I passed all the subject including Analysis for CS 2.<sup>13</sup> Then now I dont have calculus and I am aiming again for a scholarship, I wish I can get it because I want to help my parents financially because these days my parents are having trouble with money because of this pandemic.<sup>14</sup> Learning from online for me is hard because I don't have enough space to study and my environment is noisy.<sup>15</sup> Not like in face to face we got a room and it is quiet when profs are discussing not like here in my house it is very noisy because we only have one room and we are five living in.<sup>16</sup> I am doing my best to learn form online because I don't want to fail my parents.<sup>17</sup> I have many more to learn in college, thats why I am hoping that this pandemic shall end and bring us back to the way it was, because for me learning online is different from learning in face to face.<sup>18</sup> I hope that next school year will be better and I hope that we will have our face to face meeting next school year.<sup>19</sup> College is still ahead of me and I want to make my parents proud so that their sacrifice will not go to waste.<sup>20</sup></b></p></blockquote>
